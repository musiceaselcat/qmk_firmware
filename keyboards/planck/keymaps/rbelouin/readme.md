# @rbelouin’s Planck Layout

This layout is being designed having the following principles in mind:

- It leverages [BÉPO](https://bepo.fr), as it makes typing both French and English more comfortable than AZERTY and QWERTY in my experience
- Coding characters should be easily accessible
- It can be used to edit or play music
- It aims at making hand movements as minimal as possible
