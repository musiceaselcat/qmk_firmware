# @rbelouin’s Planck Layout

This layout is being designed having the following principles in mind:

- It leverages [BÉPO](https://bepo.fr), as it makes typing both French and English more comfortable than AZERTY and QWERTY in my experience
- Coding characters should be easily accessible
- It can be used to edit or play music
- It aims at making hand movements as minimal as possible

## Sequencer

This layout makes use of the [MIDI step sequencer feature](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/9703). If you use my layout with no modification, you can enable it by pressing `LOWER` + `RAISE` + `bottom left key`, a demo of the feature can be found on [this video](https://youtu.be/wOovAkLTHHM)
